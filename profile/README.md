# DreamWeave-MP is a community of OpenMW contributors and modders whom wish to advance the state of the art in OpenMW.

Originally the scope of the project was to update TES3MP to 0.49, but after six months of dedicated work, the team agreed to abandon this goal in favor of a fresh reimplementation based on OpenMW 0.49, with no descendancy from TES3MP whatsoever. You can find this project in our [sister organization on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/dreamweave-mp).

The GitHub organization serves as a base through with DreamWeave-MP coordinates with the upstream TES3MP organization, and through which mods and modding tools are delivered. Dreamweave's GitHub organization also serves modlists compatible with OpenMW 0.49 and onward.

Please find us online at the [OpenMW discord](https://discord.gg/ayrS6neQrj) for assistance, queries, or contributions.
